This project implements a fraud detection system using Random Forest, XGBoost. It leverages Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Seaborn, and Matplotlib for data processing and visualization. SMOTE is used to handle class imbalance, ensuring better fraud prediction. The models are evaluated using a classification report and confusion matrix, making this project valuable for financial security, anomaly detection, and risk mitigation.
